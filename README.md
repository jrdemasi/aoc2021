# Advent of Code 2021

This year my goal is just to finish Advent of Code - there is a lot going on in my life, so taking a huge amount of time isn't an option right now.  As such, I am using Python with very few limitations - primarily I will not deviate from the standard library.  My solutions may not be the most elegant, but they'll be semi-organized, and they'll produce the right answers.  I'm not a developer anyway :-)
